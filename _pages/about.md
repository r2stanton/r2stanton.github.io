I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory focusing on machine learning and mathematical physics in the domain of materials science. I completed my PhD in Physics from Clarkson University in July '24 with a focus on computational and theoretical materials science. I love finding unique and interesting problems to apply a quantitative skillset to, and I have a passion for beautiful data visualization (check out [/visualization](/visualization)).<br>

My most well developed technical skills are:

- Python
- C++
- Quantitative Finance
- Machine Learning
- Numerical Methods + Scientific Computing
- Theoretical Physics
- Data Visualization


My Website
======

In the last few years I've been getting increasingly involved in quantitative finance, which is much of what you'll find on this site. While not all of my code is open source, check out the [/quant](/quant) page to see some of the math and code that I've been working on. I think of this website as a place to showcase my work related to:

- Quantitative Research
- Software Development
- Data Visualization
- Applied Machine Learning

Getting In Touch
======

If you're interested in any of the unreleased code from [/quant](/quant), or you have opportunities in the space of quantitative finance (be they research collaborations or job opportunities) please reach out to directly at robertmstanton@proton.me.
